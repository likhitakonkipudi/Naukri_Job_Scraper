# Naukri_Job_Scraper
This project is a Python script that scrapes job listings from Naukri.com using Selenium. It collects job details such as title, company, location, experience, and job link. The extracted data is stored in an Excel file (jobs.xlsx) for easy reference. It helps job seekers quickly gather relevant job postings in one place.
